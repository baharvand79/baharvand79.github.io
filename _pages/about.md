<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold;">Welcome.</span>

I am a **Computer Engineering (Software)** graduate from the **University of Tehran**. My research lies at the intersection of **Computational Neuroscience**, **NeuroAI**, and **Machine Learning for Health**. I am passionate about developing AI and software solutions that decode biological complexity to enable personalized healthcare.

### Current Research
I am currently a **Research Intern at the Royan Institute**, where my work focuses on two distinct areas:
* **NeuroAI & Coding:** Analyzing High-Density Multi-Electrode Array (HD-MEA) recordings using statistical techniques to evaluate how biological neural networks encode spatial activity patterns.
* **Health Informatics:** Designing a data analysis platform that utilizes smartphone and smartwatch data to monitor Parkinson's disease progression and generate clinical reports.

### Selected Achievements
* **Best Undergraduate Project (2025):** I was awarded for my thesis, *"Development of a System for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis Through Voice Analysis Using AI"*. I designed **MPD-Net**, a hybrid CNN-LSTM-Attention architecture, which achieved an AUC score of **1.00** on the IPVS dataset and **0.87** on UAMS.
* **Publication:** I co-authored *"The Eu-Ret mouse is a novel model of hyperdiploid B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia"*, published in ***Leukemia*** (May 2024).
* **Neuromatch Academy (2024):** I completed intensive training in Computational Neuroscience, modeling behavioral predictions using keypoint-based features on the CalMS21 dataset.

### Featured Projects

**MPD-Net: Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis**
* **Overview:** Designed a hybrid deep learning architecture to detect Parkinson's disease from voice recordings.
* **Methodology:** Utilized a **CNN-LSTM-Attention** model to capture both spatial features (spectrograms) and temporal dependencies in speech. Implemented **Grad-CAM** and **SHAP** for model interpretability.
* **Results:** Achieved **AUC scores of 1.00** (IPVS), **0.87** (UAMS), and **0.65** (mPower).
* **Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/baharvand79/MPD-Net-Parkinsons-Voice-Diagnosis)

**Transcriptomic Analysis of B-cell Leukemia**
* **Overview:** Contributed computational analysis for the characterization of the *Eu-Ret* mouse model.
* **Methodology:** Performed analysis of **bulk RNA sequencing data** using **R** (tidyverse, DESeq2, clusterProfiler). Conducted differential expression and pathway enrichment analyses to identify dysregulated genes in leukemic populations.
* **Outcome:** Published in *Leukemia* (2024).

**Behavioral Prediction Model (Neuromatch Academy)**
* **Overview:** Built a supervised behavioral prediction model using the CalMS21 dataset.
* **Methodology:** Employed **keypoint-based features** to model and predict animal behavior within a computational neuroscience framework.

### Background
Previously, I served as a Research Intern at the **BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR)** in Vancouver. There, I performed computational analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data using R and conducted differential expression analyses on leukemic B-cell populations.
I have also led workshops on R programming, RNA-Seq analysis, and Computational Neuroscience for students.

### Technical Toolkit
* **Languages:** Python, R, C++, Java, Kotlin.
* **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Deep Learning (CNNs, LSTMs, Attention), Model Interpretability (SHAP, Grad-CAM).
* **Bioinformatics:** Neural Data Analysis, Bulk RNA-seq, Differential Expression Analysis.
* **Tools:** Git, Linux, Docker, Power BI, Qt Framework.

### Life Outside the Academia!
I enjoy <span style="color:#8e44ad">classic poems</span> and <span style="color:#e91e63">webtoons</span>. I also like to <span style="color:#c0392b">draw comics</span>. I have a unique appreciation (yes… appreciation!) for <span style="color:#27ae60">lizards</span> 🦎 and find joy in <span style="color:#2980b9; font-family: monospace">coding</span> - not just as a tool for science, but as a creative medium. And coding without a cup of <span style="color:#6d4c41">coffee</span> ☕? I don’t think that’s possible! 🙂
