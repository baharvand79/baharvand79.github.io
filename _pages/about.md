<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold;">Welcome.</span>

I am a **Computer Engineering graduate** (B.Sc.) from the **University of Tehran**, specializing in Software. My research lies at the intersection of **Computational Neuroscience**, **NeuroAI**, and **Machine Learning for Health**. I am passionate about applying rigorous computational methods—from deep learning architectures to dynamical systems modeling—to decode biological complexity and improve clinical outcomes.

I am currently a **Research Intern at the Royan Institute**, where I work on dual tracks: analyzing high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) recordings to evaluate neural network representational capacity, and developing wearable-based monitoring systems for Parkinson's disease.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at the **BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR)** in Vancouver, where I utilized R and bioinformatics pipelines to analyze bulk RNA sequencing data for leukemia research.

### Recent Highlights
* **Best Undergraduate Project Award (2025):** Awarded by the University of Tehran for my thesis on Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis. I designed **MPD-Net** (a hybrid CNN-LSTM-Attention model), achieving an AUC of **1.00** on the IPVS dataset and **0.87** on UAMS.
* **Publication in *Leukemia* (2024):** Co-authored *"The Eu-Ret mouse is a novel model of hyperdiploid B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia"*.
* **Neuromatch Academy (2024):** Completed intensive training in Computational Neuroscience, modeling behavioral prediction using keypoint-based features.
