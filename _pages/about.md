<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold;">Welcome.</span>

I am a **Computer Engineering (Software)** graduate from the **University of Tehran**. My research lies at the intersection of **Computational Neuroscience**, **NeuroAI**, and **Machine Learning for Health**. I am passionate about developing AI and software solutions that decode biological complexity to enable personalized healthcare.

### Current Research
I am currently a **Research Intern at the Royan Institute**, where my work focuses on two distinct tracks:
* **NeuroAI & Coding:** Analyzing High-Density Multi-Electrode Array (HD-MEA) recordings using statistical and computational techniques to evaluate how biological neural networks encode patterns.
* **Health Informatics:** Designing and developing a data analysis platform that utilizes smartphone and smartwatch data to monitor disease progression, generating objective reports for clinical use.

### Selected Achievements
* **Best Undergraduate Project (2025):** I was awarded for my thesis, *"Development of a System for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis Through Voice Analysis Using AI"*. I designed **MPD-Net**, a hybrid CNN-LSTM-Attention architecture, which achieved an AUC score of **1.00** on the IPVS dataset and **0.87** on UAMS.
* **Publication:** I co-authored *"The Eu-Ret mouse is a novel model of hyperdiploid B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia"*, published in ***Leukemia*** (May 2024).
* **Neuromatch Academy (2024):** I completed intensive training in Computational Neuroscience, utilizing dynamical systems and probabilistic modeling. I also built a supervised behavioral prediction model using keypoint-based features.

### Background
Previously, I served as a Research Intern at the **BC Children's Hospital Research Institute (BCCHR)** in Vancouver, Canada. There, I performed computational analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data using R and conducted differential expression analyses on leukemic B-cell populations.

I have also led workshops on R programming, RNA-Seq analysis, and Computational Neuroscience for high school students.
